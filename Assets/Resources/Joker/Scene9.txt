<b>9   INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, APARTMENT - NIGHT                         9
</b>
    Joker brings the food to his mother, PENNY (70's), lying in
    her bed. The TV is on, playing the local news.

    Joker sets the food down in front of his mother. He covers
    the pain from his beating the best he can-- His mother
    doesn't seem to notice anyway.

<b>                        MOM
</b>              He must not be getting my letters.
<b>                                                        12.
</b>

Joker sits down on a chair next to the bed.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          He's a busy man.

<b>                    MOM
</b>          Too busy for me? I worked for that
          family for 12 years. He always had
          a smile for me. Least he could do
          is write back.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          Ma, eat. You need to eat.

<b>                    MOM
</b>          You need to eat. Look how skinny
          you are.

Before Joker can say anything, his mother points to the news
on the TV--

<b>                    MOM
</b>          All day long it's more bad news.
          That's all there is.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          Maybe you shouldn't watch so much
          television.

<b>                    MOM
</b>              (ignoring)
          He's the only hope for Gotham.
          He'll make a great mayor. Everybody
          says so.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>              (playful)
          Everybody who? Who do you talk to?

<b>                    MOM
</b>          Well everybody on the news.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          Stop it. He's not even gonna run.
          Why would Thomas Wayne want to be
          mayor? He can do more good as a
          businessman.

<b>                    MOM
</b>          Because he cares about this city.
          And everyone in it-- that's why I
          can't believe he hasn't written me
          back.
<b>                                                         13.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          He will. Now eat some dinner.

He feeds her a bite of the food.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          How you feeling today?

<b>                    MOM
</b>          I don't know. It always hits me
          worse at night, you notice that?

He shakes his head.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>              (teasing)
          Maybe it's the moon. Maybe you're a
          werewolf?

HE HOWLS SOFTLY like a wolf. She laughs.

<b>                    MOM
</b>          It's not funny.

Joker watches her as he cuts up some more of her food.

<b>                    MOM
</b>          Anyway, I wrote a new letter today.
          A better one. I want you to hand
          deliver it to him.

<b>                       JOKER
</b>          What? Why?

<b>                    MOM
</b>          Cause maybe the mailman is throwing
          them away. We should have tipped
          him at Christmas time.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          Who tips their mailman?

<b>                    MOM
</b>          Some people do. Rich people do.

Joker sighs, resigned.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          Okay. I can try his office.
          Tomorrow.
<b>                                                                14.
</b>

<b>                          MOM
</b>               Thank you.
                   (she pats the bed)
               Come sit. It's almost on.

     Joker gets into bed with her.
