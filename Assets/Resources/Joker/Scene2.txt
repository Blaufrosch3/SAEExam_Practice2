<b>2   EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE, MIDTOWN - KENNY'S MUSIC SHOP - DAY         2
</b>
    GOTHAM SQUARE IS CLOGGED WITH TRAFFIC. Non-stop honking
    horns, pedestrians crowding the sidewalk. Huge billboards,
    giant movie marquees, garbage bags piled high everywhere.
    Underneath it all we hear a TINKLING PIANO playing something
    bouncy and fast-paced.

    FROM ACROSS THE BUSY CITY STREET, we see Joker. He's dressed
    as a sad-faced HOBO CLOWN. This is his job.

    Dressed in tattered clothes, dark five o'clock shadow painted
    on his face, big bulbous red nose, his mouth's outlined in
    white, turned down at the corners.

    He's holding up a sign in front of Kenny's Music Shop that
    reads, "EVERYTHING MUST GO!" A banner above the store reads,
    "GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!" Behind him, an OLD MAN plays a piano
    on the street. Both of them there to draw attention to the
    big sale going on in the store.

    Joker's doing a little Charlie Chaplin like waddle to the
    music. Most people walk right past, ignoring him. A few bump
    into him by mistake.

    JOKER SEES A GROUP OF FIVE BOYS, no more than 15-years-old,
    walking toward him. He moves out of their way. They crack up
    laughing when they see him. Start making fun of him.

    Joker ignores them, tries to do his job the best he can while
    maintaining some dignity. Keeps dancing and holding up the
    sign.

    One of the kids knocks the sign out of Joker's hands--

<b>                        KID #1
</b>              Suck my dick, clown.

    The kids laugh. Joker doesn't say anything. Just bends over
    to pick up the sign--

    Another kid kicks him in the ass--

<b>                        KID #2
</b>              Whoops.

    Joker falls face first onto the sidewalk. Oddly, the old man
    playing the piano picks up the pace of the music--

    The kids crack up. One of the boys grabs Joker's sign and
    takes off running across the street--

    The other kids follow, weaving through traffic--

    Joker gets up and gives chase. He needs his sign back.

    He almost gets hit by a taxi, spinning out of the way just in
    time-- Spinning right into another taxi that stops just short
    of hitting him.

    Joker keeps running through traffic. People stare. A clown
    barreling down the street has got to be a joke--
