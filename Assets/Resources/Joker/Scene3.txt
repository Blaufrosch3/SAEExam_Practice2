<b>3   EXT. CORNER, SIDE STREET - GOTHAM SQUARE - CONTINUOUS            3
</b>
    The five boys are booking it down the crowded street laughing
    and whooping it up. At the last second they take a sharp
    right turn down a cross street--

    Joker almost overshoots the corner, slip-sliding in his big
    red shoes--

    He rights himself and heads down after them--

    Sees them running up ahead--

    WHAP! Out of nowhere Joker gets hit in the face!

    He falls to the ground.

    One of the kids was hiding between parked cars and hit Joker
    with the "EVERYTHING MUST GO!" sign, splintering it in two--
<b>                                                                7.
</b>

    The other kids turn back and walk up to Joker down on the
    ground.

    Joker reaches out, still trying to save the sign--

    THE KIDS START KICKING AND BEATING THE SHIT out of Joker.
    It's brutal and vicious. Nobody on the street stops to help.

    CLOSE ON JOKER'S HOBO CLOWN FACE, down on the ground. Sweat
    running down his face, smearing his make-up. He doesn't even
    look like he's in pain. He just takes the beating.

    That stupid frown painted on his face.
