<b>4   INT. CITY BUS (PULLING OUT) - HEADING DOWNTOWN - DUSK            4
</b>
    Joker, makes his way toward the back of the crowded bus, now
    walking with a slight limp, but keeping his head held high.

    His make-up's washed off, costume and props all shoved into a
    big shopping bag slung over his shoulder. Some white grease-
    paint still smudged on the sides of his face.

    He finds an empty seat in the back of the bus. Sees a sad-
    eyed FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL, face puffy from crying, sitting on
    her knees looking back at him. Her mother's facing forward,
    but even from behind you can tell she's angry.

    Joker sees the sad-eyed girl staring straight back at him. He
    doesn't know where to look, feeling self-conscious and small.
    He gets back into "character" smiling like a clown and covers
    his face with his hands-- Starts playing the peek-a-boo game
    with her.

    The girl stares back at him for a moment then giggles--

<b>                         WOMAN ON BUS
</b>                   (turns back to Joker;
                    already annoyed)
              Can you please stop bothering my
              kid?

<b>                        JOKER
</b>              I wasn't bothering her, I was--

<b>                         WOMAN ON BUS
</b>                  (interrupts)
              Just stop.

    AND SUDDENLY JOKER STARTS TO LAUGH. LOUD. He covers his mouth
    trying to hide it-- Shakes his head, laughter pausing for a
    moment, but then it comes on stronger. His eyes are sad. It
    actually looks like the laughter causes him pain.

    People on the bus are staring. The girl looks like she's
    going to cry again.

<b>                            WOMAN ON BUS
</b>                  You think that's funny?

    Joker shakes his head no, but he can't stop laughing. He
    reaches in his pocket and pulls out a small card. Hands it to
    the woman.

    CLOSE ON THE CARD, it reads: "Forgive my laughter. I have a
    condition (more on back)"

    She turns the card over and there is a bunch of information
    in small writing--
    "It's a medical condition causing sudden, frequent, uncontrollable laughter that
    doesn't match how you feel. It can happen in people with a brain injury or certain
    neurological conditions."

    She doesn't read it (but if you freeze frame the movie you
    could). She just shakes her head annoyed and throws the card
    on the ground.

    Joker laughs harder. Tears running down his face.

    Not wanting to attract any more attention to himself, he
    pulls up his red hood, and uses his threadbare scarf to cover
    his mouth, trying to muffle the laughter.

    He looks out at the city passing him by.
