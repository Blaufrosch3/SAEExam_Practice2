<b>7   INT. ELEVATOR, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS                  7
</b>
    Joker steps onto the wheezing elevator, harsh fluorescent            
    lights, graffiti on the walls. As the door closes, he hears--        

<b>                        SOPHIE (OS)
</b>              Wait!!

    He puts his foot out with some panache to stop the closing
    door-- He's a romantic at heart. Ding.

    And SOPHIE DUMOND (late 20's), tired eyes, hands filled with
    grocery bags, steps onto the elevator with GIGI, her 5-year-
    old daughter.

<b>                         SOPHIE
</b>              Thank you.
                  (realizing)
              Of course it's you,-- everyone else
              in this building is just so fucking
              rude.

    Joker nods "thanks." Holds his breath, hoping he doesn't
    start to laugh.

    Floors dinging as the elevator rises.

    Joker sees GiGi licking the dirty smudged elevator handrail
    behind her mom.

<b>                        SOPHIE
</b>              How's your mom doing?

    He takes a deep breath, he's uncomfortable talking to her,
    holds up the white prescription bag.

<b>                        JOKER
</b>              It's day to day. I'm doing
              everything I can to get her back on
              her feet.
                  (re: pharmacy bag)
              Picked up her medicine. Gonna make
              her some dinner.

<b>                        SOPHIE
</b>                  (smiles; being polite)
              She's lucky she has you--

    Joker smiles thanks, can't help but glance at GiGi licking
    the rail.

    Sophie finally notices. She wants to grab her but can't with
    her hands full. Tries to kick her away--

<b>                        SOPHIE
</b>              Jesus. Don't do that, GiGi! How
              many times have I told you that?
                  (to Joker)
              This building is so awful, isn't
              it?

    Joker just nods... he doesn't know what to say, but clearly
    wants to continue this conversation with Sophie.

    The doors open. They all step off.

<b>                        SOPHIE
</b>              Okay. Well, tell your mom I said
              hello.

    And Sophie and GiGi walk down the hall-- the opposite way of
    Joker. He just stands there for a beat. Heart beating fast.

<b>                        JOKER
</b>                  (calls out after her)
              Hey Sophie--

    She turns around.

<b>                        JOKER
</b>              I'll tell my mom you said hello.

    She smiles as in "yeah, that's what I said."
